Q1>> Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss
nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.
Ans..Qualitative>>In statistics, qualitative data (also called categorical data) refers to data that dehttps://github.com/gejendrasharma/funtion_assigment/edit/main/statisticsscribes qualities or characteristics and can be used to categorize  subjects without measuring them numerically.
Ex..gender,color,grades
Quantitative>>In statistics, quantitative data refers to numerical data that can be measured or counted, representing quantities or amounts.
Ex..height,weight,speed
Nominal>> This type categorizes data without a specific order. Examples include:
Gender (male, female, other)
Marital status (single, married, divorced)
Ordinal Data>> This type categorizes data with a meaningful order, but without consistent spacing between categories. Examples include:
Education level (high school, college, graduate)
Interval>>In statistics, interval data is a type of quantitative data where the intervals between values are meaningful and consistent, but there is no true zero point.
Ex..length,hieght
Ratio>>In statistics, a ratio scale is a type of quantitative data that has all the properties of an interval scale (equal intervals between values) plus a meaningful, absolute zero point.
Ex..hieght,time
Q2>>   What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median,
and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.
Central tendency>>cental tendency try to find out that particular element which can represent whole data.
1.mean>>Arithmatic mid value of data is called mean.
Ex..data=[1,2,3,4,5]
mean=3
2.median>>physical mid value of data is caled median.
Ex..data=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
median=4
3.mode>>mode is the maximum frequency of data.
Ex..data=[1,2,2,3,6,7,8,5,9]
mode=2
#situation where each is appropriates>>
3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7
here>>
mean=5
median=5
mode=5
Q3>>  Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?
Dispresion>>In statistics, dispersion refers to the extent to which data values are spread out or scattered around the central tendency (such as the mean or median) of a data set.
1.Range
2.Variance
3.standard deviation
4.Interquartile Range (IQR)
Q. How do variance measure the spread of data?
Variance measures the spread of data by calculating how much each data point differs from the mean, on average. 
Q.How do standard deviation measure the spread of data?
Standard deviation measures the spread of data by quantifying the average distance of each data point from the mean. It is calculated as the square root of the variance, which makes it easier to interpret because it is in the same units as the original data.
Q4>>  What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?
Box plot>>A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary.
min,25%,50%,75%,max
Q.what can it tell you about the distribution of data?
A box plot provides several insights into the distribution of data at a glance. Here are the key aspects that a box plot can reveal:
1. Central Tendency
2. Spread of Data
3. Range
4. Skewness
5. Presence of Outliers
Q5>>Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.
Ans..As we know we can not measure thw whole population that is why we take sample data and we use random sampling to take sample of data.In random sampling each of the member or element of the population has equal chance of being selevted in the sample
Q6>>Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?
Ans..Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a data distribution. It helps us understand if the data is evenly distributed around the mean or if it leans more heavily to one side.
1.Positive Skew (Right-Skewed): If the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter, the distribution is positively skewed. In this case, the mean is typically greater than the median.
2.Negative Skew (Left-Skewed): If the tail on the left side is longer or fatter, the distribution is negatively skewed. Here, the mean is typically less than the median.
3.Zero Skewness (Symmetrical Distribution): When the distribution is perfectly symmetrical, there’s no skew. The mean and median are approximately the same.
Q.How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?
Skewness affects data interpretation by influencing the measures of central tendency, variability, and assumptions
Q7>> What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?
Ans..The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion,It’s calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) and it is not affected by outlier.
IQR=Q3-Q1
Q.How it is use to detect outlier.
The interquartile range (IQR) is commonly used to detect outliers because it focuses on the spread of the central 50% of the data, ignoring extreme values. Here’s how the IQR helps identify outliers:
1.calculate Q1 and Q3
2.Compute the IQR:
IQR=Q3-Q1
3.Outlier boundry
LB=Q1-1.5*IQR
UB=Q3+1.5*IQR
Q8>> Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.
Ans..The binomial distribution is used when certain conditions are met, making it suitable for modeling binary outcomes over repeated trials. Here are the key conditions:
1.Fixed Number of Trials (n):
2.Binary Outcomes:
3.Constant Probability of Success (p):
4.Independence of Trials:
Q9>> Explain the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).
The normal distribution is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics, often used to model real-world phenomena due to its distinct properties. Here are the key properties of the normal distribution:
1.Symmetry
2.Bell Shape
3.Mean and Standard Deviation
4.Asymptotic Nature
5.Area Under the Curve Equals 1
Qempirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule)>>
In a normal distribution:
1.Approximately 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean 
2.Approximately 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean 
3.Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean 
Q10>>Provide a real-life example of a Poisson process and calculate the probability for a specific event
A Poisson process is used to model random events that occur independently and at a constant average rate over time or space. Here’s a real-life example:
Example: Call Center Customer Arrivals
Imagine a call center that receives customer service calls. The call center may find that calls come in randomly but at an average rate of, say, 10 calls per hour. If we assume that:
>Calls are independent of each other (one customer’s call doesn’t influence another’s),
>The probability of multiple calls arriving in the same instant is very low,
>The call rate remains steady over time
Q11>>Explain what a random variable is and differentiate between discrete and continuous random variables.
